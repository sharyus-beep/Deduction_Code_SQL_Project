# Data_Analysis_Project
Built a SQL-based solution to validate payroll deduction codes using ADPR data. Automated team data filtering, removed duplicates and irrelevant records, and flagged errors for ACH and off-cycle payments. Reduced Excel dependency, improved accuracy, and helped ensure on-time payroll and SLA compliance

I worked on a SQL-based deduction code validation project while handling US payroll TTS processing in the QP termination team. We were working with large ADPR datasets that included records from multiple QP teams, and manual filtering in Excel was time-consuming, especially since we had very limited time before the payroll run.

I created SQL queries to filter only relevant team data, remove unnecessary columns, detect duplicate and irrelevant batch IDs, and validate deduction codes for ACH and off-cycle payroll. The queries automatically flagged errors, which helped reduce manual work, improve accuracy, and support on-time payroll processing.

This helped the team avoid payroll delays, prevent penalties, reduce mistakes, and meet SLA timelines more consistently.
